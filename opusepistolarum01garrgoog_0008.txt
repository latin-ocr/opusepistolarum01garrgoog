iv PUBLISHER'S Noun

indicate works unfinished or unpublished. In an attempt ιο preserve
the natural order of words both here and in the General Index bold
type has been used for important words which in the more usual kind
of index would have begun the subheadings.

The General Index is one of both subjecte and names but these have
not been separately alphabetized. An asterisk before an entry indicates
crosa-reference ιο Index I for supplementur-y information. Ἴ

Ιι has proved impossible tc make crosa-referencing exhaustive and
the reader's search for the more elusive particulare may have ιο ιο
pursued in several different plaoes. Some other necessary limitatione
may be touched upon. Index ΙΠ contains no general biographioal antry
for Erasmus himself: biographioal facts about him should be sought
under the appropriate hesdinge: for example, death, illegitimacy,
journeys, names, lec. His place cf residence at different times can ιο
ascertained from the Table of Lattara at the beginning cf each volume
Places visited by him but from which no letters have been dated are
recorded in the Indexes from Volume 11 onwards.

Other biographical references to Erasmm will be found under the
names of tha persons and places with which they are connected. Some
entries will be found for Erasmus' use cf Latin and Greek Termini but
these are arbitrarily selected and make no claime tc being complete.

Index ΠΙ includes tha names of all medieval persons mentioned, all
humanists and contemporaries of Erasmus, and all Saints. Names from
classical antiquity, fictional charactera, and mythological ligures arc
included only where they are substantially discussed. It was considered
impracticabla to index all authors quoted.

· Where a person is referred to by a title only in the text—for example,
Episcopus, without tha see being mentioned-reference is usually given
to page and line, the line reference in subscript figures. But where
Allen's note gives tha full name, as a rule page references only are given.

Institutions such as collegas, Societies‚ Universities, Abbcys, and so
on are normally tc be found under the place-name of the town with
which theyareassociated. ’

Τιο Index is primarily to the text. It contains references to Allen'a
Prefaces and Notas only where these are strictly relevant.

In spite of its inevitable shortcomings the publishers hope that users
of this volume will findit a valuable aid in their approach ιο ιιο main
work. ⁴

Si qua te capit admiratio, candide lector, cur tanti operis non sit index
maior, quum tamen in parvos etiam libellos nonnulli magnos elenchos
scribere soleant: non temere id evenisse scias . . . ridiculum duximus, omnia
in elenchum conferre . . . quis nescit quantum inde acervum possit annotare,
quae tamen louge rectius ex ipso libro petest Proinde nos summis rerum
capitibus, inter legendum tumultuarie, non tamen oscitanter, oboervatia
indicatisque, noluimus studiosum lectorem sua fraudare industria.
