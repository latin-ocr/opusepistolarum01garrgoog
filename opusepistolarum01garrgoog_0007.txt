PUBLISHER’S ΝΟΤΕ

P. S. Arre-r began to work on hisedition 01 Erasmus' wnespondenoe
in 1893 and the first volume was published in 1906. Η1 died in 1933
with the edition more than half complete. His wife, the late Mrs. H. M.
Allen, and his friend, Professor Garrod, continued the work; and the
last volume of the text, Volume XI, appeared in 1947. Only the index
was lacking to complete the great task which Allen had undertaken
more than half a century before.

No one but Allen himself could have mede an index worthy 01 his
author and of his own magisterial editing. It would have been 11 ex·
heustive N ame and Subject Index to both text and notes, and it would
have dealt with Erasmus' language and Latinity, his syntax and his
style, and many another' topic of which Allen's long service tc Erasmus
had given him a unique knowledge.

Even though 11 index on this scale was no longer possible Mrs. Allen,
Professor Garrod, and the Delegates 01 the Clarendon Press were all
agreed that a servioeable index 10 the whole edition should none the
less be provided and after the publication of Volume XI Miss M. Alford .
was asked to compile one. This she set about doing but, in spite of her
heroic labours‚ the work was 111 from complete at her death in 1951.

Her place was taken by Miss Barbara Flower who planned the index
afresh and brought tp the new startg'reet qualities of zest and scholar·
ship. She hed just completed the index in slips when, in 1955, she died
suddenly and prematurely, a loss not only to the edition but 10 the world
01 classical learning. Fortunately, her friend and fellow scholar, Miss
Elisabeth Rosenbaum, undertook to arrange and prepare the Index as
Miss Flower had drafted it and 10 see it through the Press. And 1ο 11
last the great edition may be said 10 be complete. In the course of
compilation many obligations to persons were no doubt incurred which
Miss Alford or MIss Flower would have been zealous to acknowledge.
11 is hoped that the persons concerned will forgive the absence 01
detailed acknowledgement which the deaths 01 these editors made
inevitable, but the publishers would not like to let the occasion pass
without mention 01 what their records make apparent, the constant
assistance and· support in the project rendered by the Director and

. Staff of the Warburg Institute.

This volume contains three separate indexes: Index 1, the Index 01
, correspondents and Some Biographical Notices; Index Π, the Index
of Erasmus' Writingsz and Index III, the General Index. ·
· The Index 01 correspondents repeats and consolidates whatisaheady
in the Index 01 Correspondents at the end 01 each volume. It is intended
’ to supply a rapid means 01 establishing whether a given person was in
correspondenoe with Erasmus. Some of the biographical matter in this
index is supplementary to that contained in the General lndex and in
giech (dISIed an aeterisk is given before the appropriate entry in the

ner dex. ¹

The Index of Erasmus' Writings is subdivided into (A) Original
Works and (B) Editions, Translations, and Prefaces, and deals with any
mention of these that may occur in the letters. Brackets are used to
